# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
# The Airgead Banking application, a collaborative effort between Chada Tech and Airgead Banking, addresses the need to educate high school students on fiscal responsibility, focusing on investing and compound interest. This interactive system enables students to input initial investment, annual interest rate, and # investment duration, and then visualizes the growth of their investments over time using compound interest calculations. By providing practical insights into financial concepts, the application empowers students to make informed decisions about managing their finances, aligning with the broader goal of promoting financial literacy and responsible money management among the youth.

# What did you do particularly well?
# In my code, I've managed to achieve several strengths. One of the standout aspects is how I've modularized it into separate files, following object-oriented design principles to establish the investmentAccount class and effectively encapsulate functionalities. My implementation of input validation stands out, as it ensures that only valid and positive real numbers are accepted, enhancing the user experience. The way I've formatted the output reports is another highlight â€“ they're not only well-organized and readable but also feature an appealing ASCII art title for a touch of creativity. I've taken great care to include extensive comments and documentation, significantly contributing to the overall code clarity. The consistent use of naming conventions further aids in understanding. Efficient calculations considering various investment scenarios are a strong point, and I've also skillfully managed errors using cin.clear() and cin.ignore(). Altogether, my code showcases meticulous planning, attention to detail, and adept implementation of the given requirements.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
# There are several areas where my code could be enhanced to make it even better. While my current input validation is strong, I could offer clearer error messages to guide users better. Implementing unit tests would ensure accurate calculations, and I could add high-level comments for better code understanding. As I progress, I should look for code optimization opportunities while prioritizing readability, and adding user prompts would improve usability.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
# The most challenging parts of writing the code were the compound interest calculations and implementing input validation. To overcome this, I studied relevant mathematical formula from the document specification and consulted online resources to ensure accurate calculations. For input validation, I researched best practices and examples, incorporating error-handling techniques to improve user experience. To enhance my support network, I plan to join programming forums and communities to seek advice, share insights, and learn from others' experiences. Additionally, I'll explore online courses and tutorials to deepen my understanding of specific concepts and tools related to C++ programming.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
# The skills I've gained from this project have several valuable applications in other projects and coursework. First and foremost, my proficiency in implementing object-oriented programming principles will carry over, allowing me to create well-organized and modular code structures. Additionally, my experience in handling user input validation and implementing error handling strategies will be highly transferable, enhancing the reliability and user-friendliness of future projects.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
# I focused on ensuring that this program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable by adhering to best coding practices. I organized the code into separate files for different functionalities, such as class implementation and main function, promoting modularization and ease of maintenance. Descriptive variable and function names, along with extensive comments, enhance code readability, making it easier for me and others to understand the logic and purpose of each section. By using object-oriented principles, I encapsulated related functionalities within the investmentAccount class, enabling easy modifications or extensions in the future. Additionally, I implemented error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unforeseen situations, contributing to the program's adaptability and robustness.
